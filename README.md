# Predicting and Generating Wellness Needs for Women in Kenya Based on the Hormone Cycle

## 1. Overview
This project aims to address the gap in understanding how hormonal variations throughout the menstrual cycle influence mood, symptoms, and energy levels. Many women lack tools that translate these variations into actionable insights for wellness management. Using machine learning, this study predicts mood and energy fluctuations, then provides phase-based nutrition and activity recommendations.

## 2. Problem Statement
Women experience hormonal fluctuations each month that directly influence their physical and emotional states. However, few tools exist that connect these fluctuations to daily wellness outcomes such as fatigue, irritability, or motivation. Research by **Korobeynikov et al. (2019)** found that emotional exhaustion varies significantly across menstrual phases, while **Daniel & Jill (2006)** linked estrogen levels to improved cognitive function.  
Despite these insights, most menstrual tracking applications only log cycle dates and physical symptoms. This lack of contextual awareness exposes women—especially in developing countries—to burnout and decreased productivity.  
This project proposes a data-driven predictive model capable of forecasting mood and energy, and offering personalized recommendations based on the hormonal phase, bridging the gap between simple tracking and proactive wellness planning.

## 3. Objectives
1. To build a predictive machine learning model that estimates mood, energy, and symptom variations across the menstrual cycle.  
2. To design a rule-based recommendation system that provides personalized wellness suggestions based on predicted outcomes.  
3. To evaluate model performance and identify key features influencing wellness fluctuations.
